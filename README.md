Google-Ripples
==============

For generating the Ripples-effect from the new Google Material Design-guide


How to use
=============

- Include ripples.js to your project
- On document.ready fire Ripples.setup()
- On window.load fire Ripples.init()

Remember!!
=============
- This "plugin" depends on jQuery
- Every ripple-element should have the attribute data-ripple
- The ripple-element must NOT be a self-closing element!
- The ripple-element will, if it doesn't already have it, get the css attribute position set to "relative" in order to work properly 

Enjoy!
